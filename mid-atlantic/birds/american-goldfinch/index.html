      <h2>How to spot one</h2>
      <p>
        In summer, male goldfinches are easy to recognize: <strong>bright yellow body</strong>,
        <strong>black wings with white markings</strong>, and a <strong>small cone-shaped beak</strong>.
        Females and winter birds are more muted—often olive or pale yellow.
      </p>

      <h2>Where you’ll see them (Mid-Atlantic)</h2>
      <p>
        Look in <strong>open fields, meadows, parks, gardens</strong>, and along
        <strong>roadsides</strong> where wildflowers grow. They also visit feeders—especially if you offer seeds.
      </p>

      <h2>What they eat</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Seeds</strong> (especially thistle/nyjer and sunflower)</li>
        <li><strong>Flower heads</strong> (they love pulling seeds from plants)</li>
        <li><strong>Small insects</strong> (occasionally, especially in summer)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Listen for this</h2>
      <p>
        Goldfinches have cheerful, bouncy calls. One common flight call is often described as
        “<strong>po-ta-to-chip!</strong>” as they bounce through the air.
      </p>

      <h2>Kid challenge</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Can you find the <strong>black wings</strong> and <strong>white wing bars</strong>?</li>
        <li>How many goldfinches can you spot without moving your feet?</li>
        <li>Find a flower or plant with a seed head—can you imagine a goldfinch eating from it?</li>
      </ul>
