      <h2>How to spot one</h2>
      <p>
        Look for a medium-sized bird with a <strong>bright yellow chest</strong> marked by a
        <strong>bold black “V”</strong>. The back is brown and streaked, helping it blend in with grasses.
        Meadowlarks often walk on the ground rather than hopping like many songbirds.
      </p>

      <h2>Where you’ll see them (Mid-Atlantic)</h2>
      <p>
        Eastern Meadowlarks live in <strong>open fields, meadows, pastures, and grasslands</strong>.
        You’ll often hear them singing from fence posts or see them rising suddenly from tall grass.
      </p>

      <h2>What they eat</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Insects</strong> (beetles, grasshoppers, caterpillars)</li>
        <li><strong>Seeds and grains</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Spiders</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Listen for this</h2>
      <p>
        The Eastern Meadowlark is famous for its <strong>clear, flute-like whistle</strong>.
        The song often sounds slow and musical, carrying far across open fields.
      </p>

      <h2>Kid challenge</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Can you find the <strong>black V</strong> on the yellow chest?</li>
        <li>Can you spot a meadowlark walking through grass instead of flying?</li>
        <li>Close your eyes—can you tell where the song is coming from?</li>
      </ul>
