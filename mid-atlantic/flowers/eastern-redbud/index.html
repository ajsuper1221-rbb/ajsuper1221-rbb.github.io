      <h2>How to recognize it</h2>
      <p>
        Eastern Redbud is a small tree with <strong>bright pink to purple flowers</strong>
        that bloom directly on the branches and trunk—a trait called
        <strong>cauliflory</strong>. Later in spring, it grows distinctive
        <strong>heart-shaped leaves</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Where you’ll find it (Mid-Atlantic)</h2>
      <p>
        Look for redbuds along <strong>woodland edges</strong>, in <strong>parks</strong>,
        and planted in <strong>yards and neighborhoods</strong>.
        They thrive in partial sun and well-drained soil.
      </p>

      <h2>What’s special about it</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Early bloomer:</strong> flowers appear before leaves</li>
        <li><strong>Heart-shaped leaves</strong> in late spring and summer</li>
        <li><strong>Pollinator friendly:</strong> important early nectar source</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Kid challenge</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Can you spot flowers growing <strong>right on the branches</strong>?</li>
        <li>Look later in spring—can you find a <strong>heart-shaped leaf</strong>?</li>
        <li>Count how many branches have flowers on them.</li>
      </ul>
