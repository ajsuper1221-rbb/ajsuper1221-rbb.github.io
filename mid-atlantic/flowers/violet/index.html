      <h2>How to recognize it</h2>
      <p>
        Violets are low-growing plants with <strong>heart-shaped leaves</strong> and
        <strong>five-petaled flowers</strong> that are usually purple, blue, or violet.
        Some species may appear white or yellow.
      </p>

      <h2>Where you’ll find it (Mid-Atlantic)</h2>
      <p>
        Look for violets in <strong>lawns, gardens, woodlands, and along paths</strong>.
        They often pop up in early spring, even before grass has fully greened.
      </p>

      <h2>What’s special about it</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Early bloomer:</strong> one of the first flowers of spring</li>
        <li><strong>Ground cover:</strong> spreads gently across open areas</li>
        <li><strong>Pollinator friendly:</strong> visited by bees and butterflies</li>
      </ul>
