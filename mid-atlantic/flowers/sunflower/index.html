      <h2>How to recognize it</h2>
      <p>
        Sunflowers are tall plants with a thick stem, large rough leaves, and a big flower head.
        What looks like one giant flower is actually made of many tiny flowers packed together
        in the center, surrounded by <strong>bright yellow petals</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Where you’ll find it (Mid-Atlantic)</h2>
      <p>
        You’ll see sunflowers in <strong>gardens, farms, fields</strong>, and sunny edges of open spaces.
        Some species are wild, while others are grown on purpose for their seeds.
      </p>

      <h2>Why animals love it</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bees</strong> and <strong>butterflies</strong> visit the flower center for nectar and pollen</li>
        <li><strong>Birds</strong> love the seeds later in the season</li>
        <li>Other wildlife may eat fallen seeds</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Kid challenge</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Count petals—how many “sun rays” do you see?</li>
        <li>Look at the center—can you see tiny patterns where seeds will form?</li>
        <li>Watch the flower over time—does it look different as seeds develop?</li>
      </ul>
