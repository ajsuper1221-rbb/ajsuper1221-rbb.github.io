      <h2>How to spot one</h2>
      <p>
        Ruffed Grouse are medium-sized, chicken-like birds that blend into the woods with
        <strong>mottled brown, gray, and tan feathers</strong>. Look for a rounded body,
        a small head, and a <strong>fan-shaped tail</strong> (often with a darker band near the tip).
      </p>

      <h2>Where you’ll see them (Mid-Atlantic)</h2>
      <p>
        They live in <strong>forests with thick undergrowth</strong>—especially young woods,
        woodland edges, and mixed forests. You’re more likely to spot one on or near the ground
        than perched out in the open.
      </p>

      <h2>What they eat</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Buds and twigs</strong> (especially in winter)</li>
        <li><strong>Leaves and berries</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Insects</strong> (more common in warmer months)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Listen for this</h2>
      <p>
        In spring, males make a famous “<strong>drumming</strong>” sound by beating their wings.
        It starts slow and speeds up—like a soft engine starting or a distant thump-thump-thump.
      </p>

      <h2>Kid challenge</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Can you find a place where a grouse could <strong>hide</strong> (leaf litter, shrubs, fallen logs)?</li>
        <li>How many “wood colors” can you name in its camouflage?</li>
        <li>If you hear the drumming sound, can you point to where it’s coming from?</li>
      </ul>
