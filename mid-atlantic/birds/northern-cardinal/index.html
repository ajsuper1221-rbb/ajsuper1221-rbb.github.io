      <h2>How to spot one</h2>
      <p>
        Look for a <strong>chunky songbird</strong> with a <strong>tall crest</strong> (that pointed “hairdo”) and a <strong>thick orange beak</strong>.
        Adult males are famous for their <strong>bright red</strong> color and a <strong>black face mask</strong> around the beak.
      </p>

      <h2>Where you’ll see them (Mid-Atlantic)</h2>
      <p>
        Cardinals love <strong>shrubs, hedges, parks, and backyards</strong>—especially places with cover.
        In many Mid-Atlantic neighborhoods, you can spot them all year.
      </p>

      <h2>What they eat</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Seeds</strong> (sunflower is a favorite at feeders)</li>
        <li><strong>Berries</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Insects</strong> (especially in warmer months)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Listen for this</h2>
      <p>
        Cardinals often sing loud, clear whistles. If you hear a bright, repeated whistle from a tree line,
        look for a flash of red.
      </p>

      <h2>Kid challenge</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Can you find the <strong>crest</strong>?</li>
        <li>Can you spot the <strong>black mask</strong> around the beak?</li>
        <li>How many shades of red can you count in the feathers?</li>
      </ul>
