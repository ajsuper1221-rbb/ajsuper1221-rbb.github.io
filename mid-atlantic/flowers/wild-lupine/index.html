      <h2>How to recognize it</h2>
      <p>
        Wild Lupine has a tall flower spike covered in many small blooms. The flowers are
        often <strong>blue to purple</strong>, sometimes with white highlights. The leaves are
        distinctive: each one is made of several narrow leaflets that spread out like a
        <strong>hand or star</strong> (called <em>palmate</em> leaves).
      </p>

      <h2>Where you’ll find it (Mid-Atlantic)</h2>
      <p>
        Look for Wild Lupine in <strong>open sandy areas</strong>, sunny woodland edges,
        pine barrens, and dry meadows. It prefers full sun and well-drained soil.
      </p>

      <h2>Why it’s special</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Native wildflower</strong> that supports many pollinators</li>
        <li><strong>Pea family plant</strong> (its flowers have a “pea” shape)</li>
        <li>Often grows in patches where soil is sandy and sunny</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Kid challenge</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Can you find the leaf that looks like a <strong>hand</strong> or a <strong>star</strong>?</li>
        <li>Count how many tiny flowers are on one spike.</li>
        <li>Watch for bees—how many visit the flower spike in one minute?</li>
      </ul>
