      <h2>How to spot one</h2>
      <p>
        Look for a medium-sized thrush with a <strong>warm brown back</strong> and a
        <strong>bright white chest covered in bold dark spots</strong>. The spots are round and
        easy to see—like someone dotted the chest with ink.
      </p>

      <h2>Where you’ll see them (Mid-Atlantic)</h2>
      <p>
        Wood Thrushes live in <strong>deciduous forests</strong> with a leafy understory, often near
        streams or moist areas. They prefer shady woods over open fields and are most often seen
        in the lower canopy or on the forest floor.
      </p>

      <h2>What they eat</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Insects</strong> (beetles, ants, caterpillars)</li>
        <li><strong>Worms</strong> and other small invertebrates</li>
        <li><strong>Berries and fruit</strong> (especially later in summer)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Listen for this</h2>
      <p>
        The Wood Thrush’s song is <strong>flute-like</strong> and often sounds like two notes at once.
        It echoes through the forest, especially at dawn and dusk.
      </p>

      <h2>Kid challenge</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Can you count the <strong>spots</strong> on the chest (or estimate how many there are)?</li>
        <li>Listen quietly—can you hear a song that sounds like it’s coming from deep in the woods?</li>
        <li>Can you spot a thrush hopping on the forest floor looking for food?</li>
      </ul>
