      <h2>How to spot one</h2>
      <p>
        Red-tailed Hawks are large birds of prey with <strong>broad, rounded wings</strong>
        and a <strong>short, wide tail</strong>. Adults usually show a
        <strong>rusty-red tail</strong> and a pale chest with a darker “belly band.”
      </p>

      <h2>Where you’ll see them (Mid-Atlantic)</h2>
      <p>
        Look for Red-tailed Hawks in <strong>open areas</strong> like fields, highways,
        parks, and forest edges. They often perch on tall trees or poles and soar high
        in wide circles.
      </p>

      <h2>What they eat</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Small mammals</strong> (mice, squirrels, rabbits)</li>
        <li><strong>Birds</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Reptiles</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Listen for this</h2>
      <p>
        The Red-tailed Hawk’s call is a long, raspy scream often heard in movies.
        It sounds like “<strong>keeeeee-ahhh</strong>” and is frequently used as a
        sound effect for many different raptors.
      </p>

      <h2>Kid challenge</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Can you spot the <strong>red tail</strong> when the hawk flies?</li>
        <li>Watch it soaring—how wide are its wings?</li>
        <li>Listen carefully—does the call sound familiar from TV or movies?</li>
      </ul>
