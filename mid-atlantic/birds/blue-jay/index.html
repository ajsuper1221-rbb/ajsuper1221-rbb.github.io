      <h2>How to spot one</h2>
      <p>
        Blue Jays are medium-sized birds with <strong>bright blue wings and back</strong>,
        a <strong>white chest</strong>, and a <strong>black necklace</strong> across the throat.
        They have a noticeable <strong>crest</strong> on their head that rises and falls.
      </p>

      <h2>Where you’ll see them (Mid-Atlantic)</h2>
      <p>
        Look for Blue Jays in <strong>woodlands, parks, neighborhoods</strong>,
        and forest edges. They’re common at feeders and often travel in family groups.
      </p>

      <h2>What they eat</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Acorns and nuts</strong> (a favorite)</li>
        <li><strong>Seeds</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Insects</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Occasional eggs or nestlings</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Listen for this</h2>
      <p>
        Blue Jays are loud and expressive. Their most common call is a sharp
        “<strong>jay! jay!</strong>” They can also <strong>imitate hawk calls</strong>,
        which sometimes scares other birds away.
      </p>

      <h2>Kid challenge</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Can you spot the <strong>blue-and-black patterns</strong> on the wings?</li>
        <li>Watch the crest—does it go up when the bird is excited?</li>
        <li>Listen carefully—can you tell a real jay call from a fake hawk call?</li>
      </ul>
