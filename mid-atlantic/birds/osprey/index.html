      <h2>How to spot one</h2>
      <p>
        Ospreys are large birds of prey with <strong>long, narrow wings</strong> and a
        <strong>white head marked by a dark stripe through the eye</strong>.
        They often hover over water before plunging down to catch fish.
      </p>

      <h2>Where you’ll see them (Mid-Atlantic)</h2>
      <p>
        Look for Ospreys near <strong>rivers, bays, lakes, and coastlines</strong>.
        They’re common around the Chesapeake Bay and often nest on platforms, poles,
        or other high structures near water.
      </p>

      <h2>What they eat</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fish</strong> (almost exclusively)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Listen for this</h2>
      <p>
        Ospreys have a <strong>high, whistling call</strong> that sounds sharp and repeated,
        often heard near nests.
      </p>

      <h2>Kid challenge</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Watch for a bird <strong>hovering</strong> over water.</li>
        <li>Can you spot the <strong>dark eye stripe</strong>?</li>
        <li>If it dives, did it come back up with a fish?</li>
      </ul>
